Hi Sandesh

To shortlist you for the position as well as assess your abilities towards the skillset we require we have formulated this sample task for you.

Build a minimal one-to-one real-time chat in Next.js where two users can message each other.

Messages must sync instantly via WebSockets and persist in Postgres using Prisma (history survives refresh).

Framework: Next.js (App Router).
Database/ORM: Postgres + Prisma (with migrations).
Realtime: Self-hosted WebSockets (no Pusher/Ably/Supabase Realtime).
Persistence: Messages stored and reloaded from Postgres
Seed Data: Exactly two demo users for testing.
Environment: Provide .env.example.
Containerization: Dockerize the app (app + Postgres). Provide working Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
Auth: Add any OAuth provider if possible (e.g., Google/GitHub). Fallback to a lightweight session for the two seeded users if OAuth is not configured.

The project will be majorly graded on how you use the above-mentioned tech stack, you may skip any cosmetic or ui related changes on the webapp

We encourage usage of AI tools contingent you evaluate the code generate yourself. We stand by the philosophy that as long as you stand accountable for your own code, you are free to use any tool to speed up your development.

Your deadline is 48 hours, let me know if you have any questions
